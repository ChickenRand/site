- Sometimes, the rng hangs when user quit the experiment
	=> It shouldn't happend anymore cause rng connexion is only in fullscreen, if the user leave fullScreen, rng is stopped
	=> Added a check on the onbeforeunload event
- Check when the user leaveFullScreen and re ask for it, if he doesn't authorize it, cancel the experiment.
- Add a concentration column in UserXp and ask for 0 to 10 the level of concentration after an experiment
